# Sales Analysis

Here, the data contains thousands of transactions of a company in 12 files as 12 months of 2019.
We have to do exploring the data and these 5 questions through our data analysis.

Q1: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

Q2: What city sold the most product?

Q3: What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?

Q4: What products are most often sold together?

Q5: What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

I mostly use pandas and matplotlib to do the analyst.
